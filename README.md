This is a very basic project that shows how to integrate Spring Boot and MongoDB API.

This project requires a mongodb service up and running with an existing collection called **users**.
Such collection has the following schema:
1. id (which should be auto-generated by mongodb)
1. name (string)
1. userSettings (a list of pairs like { property1 : "value1", property2 : "value2" }
